# ⚡️ SPRINT 3: JavaScript II and Testing

This sprint involves developing and unit testing a set of JavaScript functions for managing film data, using `npm test` with Jest.

## 🎯 Objectives:
Create a set of eight key functions for data analysis and sorting.
Correctly apply array methods (map, filter, sort...).
Ensure the reliability of the JavaScript functions through comprehensive unit testing with Jest.

## 💻 Technology Stack:
**JavaScript (ES6+):** Function development.
**Jest:** Unit testing framework.
**npm:** Execution of the test script.

## ⭐ Aprendizajes y retos encontrados:

I've learned to work better with array manipulation using methods like **map()**, **sort()**, **includes()**, and **filter()**.
I was introduced to the world of **testing**, specifically how to execute tests in a project using **Jest**. 

The main challenges were implementing a **sort()** function that orders films by year and, if the years are the same, by title.
Also, converting the duration (Xh Ymin) to minutes in the `hoursToMinutes` function was a significant task.

This third sprint has marked a significant leap in code quality and robustness thanks to the integration of **Testing** and the deep dive into **High-Level JavaScript Functions (map, filter, reduce)**.
